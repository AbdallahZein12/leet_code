#### Stack Solution 

class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: list[int], speed: list[int]) -> int:
        pair = [[p,s] for p,s in zip(position,speed)]

        stack = []
        for p,s in sorted(pair)[::-1]: # Reverse Sorted Order 
            stack.append((target - p) / s)
            if len(stack) >= 2 and stack[-1] <= stack[-2]:
                stack.pop()

        return len(stack)
    
### Faster solution

class Solution:
    def carFleet(self, target: int, position: list[int], speed: list[int]) -> int:
        
        pairs = [(position[i], speed[i]) for i in range(len(position))]
        fleets = curtime = 0  # a car's position is always < than target at the start, so it's fine to start curtime at 0 (no fleet will be at target at time 0)
        
        for dist, speed in sorted(pairs, reverse=True):
            destination_time = (target - dist)/speed
            if curtime < destination_time:
                fleets += 1
                curtime = destination_time

        return fleets
